Project Description:
Let's build a simple event-driven application using AWS services like Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, and Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service).

Use Case: Image Upload Notification System
When an image is uploaded to an S3 bucket, a Lambda function processes the event and sends a notification through SNS.

Project Architecture:

Steps to Build the Project:
Step 1: Set Up an AWS Account
Step 2: Create an S3 Bucket (S3 Bucket Name: amc-eda-project-new)
Step 3: Create an SNS Topic (SNS Topic Name: ImageUploadNotification)
Step 4: Create a Subscription
Step 5: Create a Lambda Function (Lambda Function Name: ImageUploadProcessor)
Step 6: Add S3 trigger
Step 7: Write Lambda Function Code
Step 8: Test the System

Expected Outcome:
By following these steps, you will have created a simple event-driven application on AWS that demonstrates the core principles of EDA. This setup can be expanded to more complex scenarios as you become more comfortable with the architecture and AWS services.
